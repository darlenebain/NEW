			<p class="banner-text">FBI's privacy and cookies policies, which are updated from time to time, and copies of which can be found at https://fbi.co.uk/privacy and https://fbi.co.uk/cookie-policy (the "Privacy and Cookies Policies"), set out the terms on which FBI uses cookies and processes any personal data it collects from you or that you provide to FBI.</p>

            <h4 class="banner-title">3. Intellectual property rights</h4>			
			<p class="banner-text">FBI grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable right to access and use the Services for internal business use only, subject to the terms of this Agreement. All rights not expressly granted to you under this Agreement are reserved by FBI .</p>
			<p class="banner-text">You agree that the Services (and all related trademarks and service marks (whether registered or unregistered)) are the sole property of FBI and the Data is the sole property of FBI, and that you will not (without express written consent from FBI): (a) create derivative works based on the Services except to the extent such derivative works are an essential function for your use of the Services; (b) reproduce the Services, sell or assign, license or disclose or otherwise transfer or make available the Services in any form to any third party; (c) remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on the Services; or (d) copy, modify, reuse, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile, reverse engineer, frame, mirror or otherwise translate the Services or any portion thereof except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.</p>

			<p class="banner-text">You warrant to FBI that: (a) you possess the legal right and ability to enter into the Agreement; (b) you agree to access and utilise the Services provided by FBI only for the purposes that are permitted by the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"); and (c) neither the performance of your obligations under this Agreement nor the use of the Services will violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations in the United Kingdom and any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom where you access the Services.</p>

			<p class="banner-text">In the event of any breach of any of the foregoing warranties and undertakings, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, FBI has the right to suspend or terminate the Agreement and/or your use of the Services.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">You shall not: (a) attempt to circumvent any security measures or technical limitations of the Services; (b) mis-use the Services in a way which harms the interests of FBI, the FBI Website, any of FBI's affiliates, the Services or other customers of FBI (including, without limitation, by introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful or by attacking the FBI Website via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of-service attack); (c) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers (including without limitation URLs) in order to disguise the origin of any Data transmitted through the FBI Website; (d) create an application that may be used to violate the Agreement or other site policy; and/or (e) adversely affect FBI or FBI's name, reputation, image or goodwill in connection with your use of the Services.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">5. Liability</h4>	
			<p class="banner-text">In no event shall FBI be liable under the Agreement for any direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential losses, or any damage for loss of profits or revenue by you, any business interruption, any loss of anticipated savings, any loss of goodwill, opportunity or reputation, whether based in contract, tort, breach of statutory duty or otherwise</p>
			<p class="banner-text">In no event shall an FBI Data supplier be liable to you for any losses, damages, liabilities, claims, costs, actions and/or expenses suffered or incurred by you as a result of the use of Data by or provision of Data to you.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">6. Maintenance</h4>	
			<p class="banner-text">FBI shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that maintenance of the Services, which may require interruption or your access to the Services or any material part of it ("Maintenance Events"), shall not be performed during normal business hours provided that FBI may interrupt access to the Services at any time to perform essential emergency maintenance.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">Maintenance includes all regularly scheduled error corrections and software updates.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">FBI shall maintain and update the Services. Should you determine that the Services include a defect, you may at any time file error reports by contacting the helpdesk at: support@fbi.co.uk. During maintenance periods, FBI may, at its discretion, upgrade versions, install error corrections and apply patches to the Services or any part of it. FBI shall use all reasonable endeavours to avoid unscheduled downtime for maintenance.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">7. Services and warranty</h4>	
			<p  class="banner-text">The content accessed through use of the Services is provided for general information only and is not intended to be used as the sole basis for any business decision. It is not intended to amount to advice (of any nature) on which you should rely. You must obtain professional advice before taking or refraining from any action made based on the result of content accessed through use of the Services.</p>
			<p  class="banner-text">To the maximum extent permitted by law, FBI expressly disclaims all warranties and representations with respect to the Services not expressly set forth in the Agreement, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation, any implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy or completeness of responses or results from use of the Services, that the Services will meet specific requirements, will be available or uninterrupted, secure or free of software errors. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided on an "as is" basis and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, without any warranty of any kind and that the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services shall be borne by you.</p>
			<p  class="banner-text">FBI does not and cannot control the flow of information to and from FBI's network and other portions of the Internet. Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet services provided or controlled by third parties. At times actions or omissions of such third parties can impair or disrupt your connections to the Internet (or portions thereof). FBI cannot guarantee such events will not occur. Accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted by law, FBI disclaims any and all liability resulting from or related to such events.</p>
			<p  class="banner-text">FBI will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a virus, distributed denial-of-service attack, or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programs, data or other proprietary material due to your use of the Services or to your downloading of any content on the FBI Website or Services, or on any website linked to the FBI Website or Services, except where (and to the extent that) the matter causing the loss or damage is due to FBI's gross negligence or wilful default.</p>
			<p  class="banner-text">FBI makes reasonable commercial efforts to ensure content accessible through the Services is up-to-date and accurate. However, because FBI obtains content from a number of different sources, FBI does not endorse, support, represent, warrant or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any content accessed or accessible using the Services. If you become aware of any inaccurate or incorrect content accessed or accessible using the Services, you should inform FBI at support@fbi.co.uk and FBI will use reasonable efforts to investigate such concern and, where appropriate and possible, correct inaccurate data.  Under no circumstances (save as required by law) will FBI be liable in any way for any content accessed, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your accessing of the Services.</p>
			<p  class="banner-text">FBI assumes no responsibility for the content of websites linked on our Services.  Such links should not be interpreted as endorsement by FBI of those linked websites. FBI will not be liable for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">8. Third party claims</h4>					
			<p  class="banner-text">In the event that you are notified by a third party that such party claims rights in the Services or that use of the Services infringes the rights of such third party, you agree to: (a) notify FBI as soon as reasonably possible; and (b) at FBI's request, immediately cease to use any element of the Services that allegedly infringes third party rights.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">9. Third party claims</h4>				
			<p  class="banner-text">In the event that you are notified by a third party that such party claims rights in the Services or that use of the Services infringes the rights of such third party, you agree to: (a) notify FBI as soon as reasonably possible; and (b) at FBI's request, immediately cease to use any element of the Services that allegedly infringes third party rights.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">10. Indemnification</h4>					
			<p  class="banner-text">You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FBI and FBI’s representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, related parties, officers, directors, employees, agents, independent contractors, advertisers, partners, and co-branders, from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, that may be filed by any third party, arising out of your conduct or connection with this web site or service, your provision of content, your violation of these Terms of use, or any other violation by you of the rights of another person or party.</p>
		   <h4 class="banner-title">11. Third party services</h4>		
			<p  class="banner-text">Goods and services of third parties may be advertised and/or may be made available on or through this web site. Representations made regarding products and services provided by third parties will be governed by the policies and representations made by these third parties. The site editor will not in any manner be liable for or responsible for any of your dealings or interaction with third parties.</p>
		   <h4 class="banner-title">12. General</h4>				
			<p class="banner-text">In providing any content to the FBI Website: (a) you agree to grant FBI a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive right and license (including any moral rights or other necessary rights.) to use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, perform, promote, archive, translate, and to create derivative works and compilations, in whole or in part.  Such license will apply with respect to any form, media, technology already known at the time of provision or developed subsequently; (b) you warrant and represent that you have all legal, moral, and other rights that may be necessary to grant FBI such license; and (c) you acknowledge and agree that FBI will have the right (but not obligation), at FBI's entire discretion, to refuse to publish, or to remove, or to block access to any content you provide, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice; (d) 
			<p class="banner-text">FBI reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of the Agreement at any time to the extent the such changes are required as a result of change to applicable laws or regulations.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">If any provision of the Agreement is held by any competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part then such provision shall be construced to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision and the validity of the other provision shall not be affected thereby.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">If either party fails to exercise a right or remedy that it has or which arises in relation to the Agreement, such failure shall not prevent that party from exercising that right or remedy subsequently in respect of that or any other incident.</p>		
			<p class="banner-text">In the event that any provision of the Agreement is deemed to conflict with legislation by a court with jurisdiction over the parties, the said provision will be interpreted to reflect the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remainder of the Agreement will remain valid and applicable.  The failure of either party to assert any right under the Agreement will not be considered to be a waiver of that party’s right, and the said right will remain in full force and effect.  You agree that any claim or cause in respect of the FBI Website or its Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause arose, or the said claim or cause will be forever barred, without regard to any contrary legislation.  FBI may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement.  In this event, FBI will be relieved of any further obligation.</p>
      		<p class="banner-text">The Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of, or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.  The party irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the Agreement.</p>
