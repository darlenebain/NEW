<p>The SME Finance Monitor surveys 4,500 businesses every quarter about past borrowing events and future borrowing intentions. It is the largest such survey in the UK and since the first report was published covering Q1-2 2011 has built into a robust and reliable independent data source for all parties interested in the issue of SME finance. In total, 27 waves of interviewing have been completed, with a full report now published every half year, following completion of the Q2 and Q4 fieldwork. For 2018 the full report will continue to be published every half year as before, but the Monitor questionnaire has been revised to reflect current trends in access to finance for SMEs.</p>
