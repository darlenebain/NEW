<p>Business angels invest their own money into privately owned businesses with high-growth potential. Angel investors are also often referred to as ‘smart capital’ because, alongside the equity finance they provide, they bring business experience, strategic advice and networking opportunities. The angel investors surveyed for this report make a significant time commitment to the businesses in which they invest. Business angels are increasingly investing through networks or syndicates and may also co-invest alongside other types of finance.</p>
<p>This report presents the findings of a new survey of business angels commissioned by the British Business Bank with support from UK Business Angels Association and run by IFF Research. The findings reflect the responses of over 650 business angels, making this one of the most comprehensive surveys of angels in the UK to date.</p>
