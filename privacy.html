            <h4 class="banner-title">1. Introduction</h4>
            <p class="banner-text">FBI respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as “data” below) that may be collected by FBI. This Policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by FBI, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or agents of FBI, or that are not under FBI’s control. FBI is committed to the protection of personal data and the fundamental rights of data subjects, in compliance with relevant laws of such as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and any data protection, electronic communications or e-privacy laws, rules or guidance that are in force in the United Kingdom from time to time, including the Data Protection Act for 1998 or 2018 or any successor legislation.  Please take time to read FBI's Terms and Conditions.  FBI is not responsible or liable for any privacy issues of any third party websites we may link to.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">2. Collection of data</h4>
            <p class="banner-text">Registration of an account on the FBI Website requires a valid email address, username and password. You are not required to provide any other information if you do not want to. Please be aware that the username you choose, the email address you provide and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on the FBI Website intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration process, or depending on the way in which the FBI Website is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many websites, the FBI Website will also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information. The FBI Website also gathers usage data which may include information about how you use the FBI Website. Information about how advertising may be served on the FBI Website is set forth below.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">FBI does not collect nor process any "sensitive personal data" or other "special category data" as defined by the GDPR. It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please ensure to keep us informed if your personal data changes.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">In providing its products and services, FBI collects and aggregates commercial data from a number of publicly available sources. </p>
			<pclass="banner-text">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. By law, we are required to keep basis information about our customers for six (6) years after they cease being customers for tax and legal purposes.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">3. Use of data</h4>
            <p class="banner-text">Data may be used to customize and improve your user experience on the FBI Website.

			<p class="banner-text">FBI will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collect it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.  If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at support@FBI.co.uk.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">If we deem it necessary to share your personal data, we will require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">From time to time, we may share your personal data which involves transferring it to third parties who may be established outside the European Economic Area (EEA).  Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: (a) the country is deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; (b) we will use of specific contracts approved by the European Commission; or (c) the third party is part of the Privacy Shield which requires a similar protection of personal data shared between Europe and the United States.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">4. Storage of data</h4>
			<p class="banner-text">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidently lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and third parties who have a business need to know this information. All personal data is protected by the latest firewall and software technology.</p>
            <h4 class="banner-title">5. Marketing</h4>
			<p class="banner-text">We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly related to marketing and advertising. We may use your data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.  This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.  You will receive marketing communications from us if you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials.</p>
			<p class="banner-text">You can request that we stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time on support@FBI.co.uk.</p>

            <p class="banner-text">Like many websites, the FBI Website sets and uses cookies to enhance your user experience — to remember your personal settings, for instance. Advertisements may display on the FBI Website and, if so, may set and access cookies on your computer; such cookies are subject to the privacy policy of the parties providing the advertisement.

			<h4 class="banner-title">10. No guarantees</h4>
            <p class="banner-text">p>While this Privacy Policy states standards for maintenance of data, and while efforts will be made to meet the said standards, FBI is not in a position to guarantee compliance with these standards.
